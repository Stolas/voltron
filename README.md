Voltron
=======

Voltron is an extensible debugger interface written in Python. It allows you to attach utility views to your debugger (LLDB, GDB or VDB) that can retrieve and display data from the debugger host. By running these views in other terminal windows or panes, you can build a customised debugger user interface to suit your needs.

Built-in views are provided for:

- Registers
- Disassembly
- Stack
- Memory
- Breakpoints
- Backtrace

Voltron is built on a JSON/HTTP API which is available over TCP and UNIX domain sockets, and can be used to build custom UI views.

It looks something like this with LLDB:

And this with GDB:

Support
-------

`voltron` is built primarily for LLDB. GDB and VDB are also supported to some extent.

The following architectures are supported:

|         | lldb | gdb | vdb |
|---------|------|-----|-----|
| x86     | ✓    | ✓   | ✓   |
| x86_64  | ✓    | ✓   | ✓   |
| arm     | ✓    | ✓   | ✓   |
| arm64   | ✓    | x   | x   |
| powerpc | x    | ✓   | x   |

Installation
------------

A standard python setup script is included.

    # python setup.py install

This will install the `voltron` package and the entry point executable wherever that happens on your system.

Quick Start
-----------

1. Configure your debugger to load Voltron when it starts by sourcing the `dbgentry.py` entry point script. The full path will be inside the `voltron` package. For example, on OS X it might be */Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/voltron/dbgentry.py*.

    For LLDB:

        command script import /path/to/voltron/dbgentry.py

    For GDB:

        source /path/to/voltron/dbgentry.py
        voltron init
        set disassembly-flavor intel

    This part can go in your `.lldbinit` or `.gdbinit` so it's automatically executed when the debugger starts.

    Intel is the only disassembly flavour currently supported for syntax highlighting.

2. Start your debugger. On LLDB you need to call `voltron init` after you load the inferior, as a target must be loaded before Voltron's hooks can be installed. This means `voltron init` cannot be called from `.lldbinit` the way it can from `.gdbinit`. Hopefully this will be remedied with a more versatile hooking mechanism in a future version of LLDB (this has been discussed with the developers).

        $ lldb file_to_debug
        (lldb) voltron init

3. In another terminal (I use iTerm panes) start one of the UI views

        $ voltron view register
        $ voltron view stack
        $ voltron view disassembly
        $ voltron view backtrace
        $ voltron view command 'reg read'

4. Set a breakpoint and run your inferior. Once the inferior has started and the debugger has stopped (either because you interrupted it or because it hit a breakpoint) the views will update.

        (*db) b main
        (*db) run

5. The debugger should hit the breakpoint and the views will be updated. A forced update can be triggered with the following command:

        (lldb) voltron stopped

FAQ
---

Q. Installing on Linux is broken with an error about `blessed`

A. That's not a question, but the answer is [here](https://github.com/snare/voltron/wiki/Voltron-on-Ubuntu-14.04-with-GDB).


Q. Why do the views show "Connection refused" before the inferior has been started (on GDB)?

A. There is no clean way to hook GDB's exit, only the inferior's exit, so the Voltron server is started and stopped along with the inferior.
